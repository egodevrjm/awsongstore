  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nWorn boots on the porch, dust on the vine,\nYour shadow’s my shelter in this heart of mine.\nEvery wound I carry, you trace with care,\nFindin’ redemption in the weight we share.\nPre-Chorus\nYour touch maps secrets on my scars,\nSoft confession under midnight stars,\nI learn salvation in your arms.\nChorus\nA whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,\nThe only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.\nNo angels needed, no preacher’s sign —\nJust your hands reading verses down my broken lines.\nPost-Chorus\nHeat lingers where your breath once played,\nEvery ache and longing unafraid,\nI find my home in the debt we’ve paid.\nVerse 2\nOld truck radio hums a lonesome tune,\nMoonlight paints us in a silver cocoon.\nYour eyes hold forgiveness for the roads I’ve roamed,\nIn your arms, I’m more than the miles I’ve known.\nPre-Chorus\nYour touch maps secrets on my scars,\nSoft confession under midnight stars,\nI learn salvation in your arms.\nChorus\nA whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,\nThe only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.\nNo angels needed, no preacher’s sign —\nJust your hands reading verses down my broken lines.\nBridge\nWe’ve burned through sins, we’ve paid the cost,\nFound our heaven in the love we’ve lost.\nNo church could hold what we’ve designed,\nJust two souls tangled, your skin on mine.\nChorus\nA whisper in the dark, a brush on the spine,\nThe only prayers I believe in tonight are your skin on mine.\nNo angels needed, no preacher’s sign —\nJust your hands reading verses down my broken lines.\nOutro\nHeat lingers where your breath once played,\nEvery ache and longing unafraid.\nUnder these stars, we’ll never resign,\nI’ll keep on prayin’ with your skin on mine.",
