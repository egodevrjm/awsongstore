      "lyrics": "Gimme That Black Brew\n\n**Verse 1**  \nWalked into a shop, thought I’d get a cup,  \nBut they’re pushin’ green tea dust, and I’m all fed up.  \nMatcha this, oat milk that, five bucks for a sip,  \nTastes like lawn clippings, burns a hole in my grip.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGimme that black brew, punch me as it goes down!  \nStrong like a mule kick, wake this small-town clown!  \nNo fads, no frills, just coffee dark and true,  \nGimme that black brew, that’s what’ll get me through!  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nBarista’s talkin’ foam art, syrups by the score,  \nI just want a jolt, not a fancy pour.  \nOat milk’s got no nipples, that ain’t no cow’s delight,  \nNeed a brew to shake me, keep me workin’ till the night.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGimme that black brew, punch me as it goes down!  \nStrong like a mule kick, wake this small-town clown!  \nNo fads, no frills, just coffee dark and true,  \nGimme that black brew, that’s what’ll get me through!  \n\n**Bridge**  \nRaise a mug to the grind, to the simple and plain,  \nNo hipster nonsense cloggin’ up my brain!  \nJust boil it thick, let it scald my soul,  \nBlack brew’s the fire that makes me whole!  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGimme that black brew, punch me as it goes down!  \nStrong like a mule kick, wake this small-town clown!  \nNo fads, no frills, just coffee dark and true,  \nGimme that black brew, that’s what’ll get me through!  \n\n**Outro**  \n(Claps, hollers, banjo twang)  \nGimme that black brew, none of that LA fake,  \nPour it strong, keep me wide awake!",
