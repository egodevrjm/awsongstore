      "lyrics": "Verse 1\nCoal dust in my lungs, blood on the floor,\nDad’s fists kept time with the slam of the door.\nBorn in a town where the devil holds sway,\nI learned to take hits ‘fore I learned how to pray.\nPre-Chorus\nNo mercy in his eyes, no warmth in that house,\nJust a boy dodgin’ shadows, quiet as a mouse.\nChorus\nBorn in hell, where the sun don’t shine,\nTook my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.\nKicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,\nIn the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.\nVerse 2\nSchool by day, mines by night, no time to dream,\nRented a room with walls thin as a scream.\nSweat and black soot, my hands turned to stone,\nCarried my books and my scars all alone.\nPre-Chorus\nNo mother to hold me, no father to care,\nJust the weight of the world and the cold mountain air.\nChorus\nBorn in hell, where the sun don’t shine,\nTook my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.\nKicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,\nIn the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.\nBridge\nEvery bruise was a map of the hell I called home,\nEvery shift in the dark taught me how to roam.\nI wasn’t born to break, though they tried to bend,\nFound a spark in my heart that no devil could end.\nChorus\nBorn in hell, where the sun don’t shine,\nTook my beatings daily, paid for his cheap wine.\nKicked out at sixteen, worked the mines to survive,\nIn the dark of that town, I kept my soul alive.\nOutro\n*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*\nBorn in hell… but I’m still breathin’",

      "title": "Run From the Reaper",
      "status": "private",
      "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nThe dust kicks up behind me, on this lonesome road,\nMy boots are worn to nothin’, carryin’ this load.\nGot a warrant in my pocket, and a devil on my trail,\nRunnin’ from the reaper, but I’m bound to fail.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe wind’s howlin’ my name, through the midnight air,\nGhosts of my sins, they’re closin’ in there.\n(Chorus)\nRun from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in,\nHears my heart a-beatin’, smells my every sin.\nThrough the canyons and the shadows, I’ll ride till I’m free,\nRun from the reaper, but he’s comin’ for me.\n(Verse 2)\nMy old Chevy’s screamin’, tires spittin’ gravel fast,\nChasin’ down redemption, but I’m haunted by the past.\nEvery milepost mocks me, every star burns cold,\nThis outlaw’s soul’s too heavy, for the stories I’ve told.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe law’s lights are flashin’, in my rearview glow,\nBut the reaper’s shadow’s darker, and he won’t let go.\n(Chorus)\nRun from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in,\nHears my heart a-beatin’, smells my every sin.\nThrough the canyons and the shadows, I’ll ride till I’m free,\nRun from the reaper, but he’s comin’ for me.\n(Bridge)\nI’ve burned too many bridges, left too many scars,\nStole a piece of heaven, under these cruel stars.\nBut if I keep on runnin’, maybe I’ll outsmart,\nThat cold hand of fate, tearin’ at my heart.\n(Chorus)\nRun from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in,\nHears my heart a-beatin’, smells my every sin.\nThrough the canyons and the shadows, I’ll ride till I’m free,\nRun from the reaper, but he’s comin’ for me.\n(Outro)\nSo I’ll race this endless highway, till my engine dies,\nWith the reaper in my mirror, and fire in my eyes.\nOne last shot at freedom, one last rebel plea,\nRun from the reaper… but he’s comin’ for me.\nYeah, he’s comin’ for me. (Keep on runnin’ free.)\nComin’ for me.\nAcoustic sound: A raw, heart-pounding acoustic ballad with an urgent, mid-tempo pulse blends stripped-down vulnerability with fierce intensity, anchored by driving guitar and weathered, urgent vocals that evoke a high-stakes personal journey.\nPotential Sound:\nA high-octane outlaw country rocker with a driving, mid-to-up-tempo pulse, blending gritty authenticity with cinematic intensity. Anchored by twangy electric guitars and a relentless acoustic strum, the track pulses with a galloping kick drum and a deep, rumbling bassline, evoking a fugitive’s desperate ride. A searing pedal steel wail and occasional banjo plucks add raw country soul, while sparse harmonica stabs heighten the tension. The vocal delivery is weathered and urgent, with gritty, conversational phrasing and subtle backing harmonies that carry a ghostly edge. The tone is rebellious, desperate, and vivid, conjuring a lone outlaw tearing through a desert under a blood-red sky, perfect for a high-stakes Western chase scene, a modern country musical climax, or a road-trip playlist staple.\nWhy It’s Not a Ballad:\nTempo and Energy: The song now has a faster, driving rhythm, with a galloping beat and urgent guitar riffs that evoke a chase rather than a slow, mournful ballad. The energy is high, pushing the narrative forward like a fugitive on the run. Outlaw Country Core: It retains the genre’s raw storytelling, with vivid imagery (dusty roads, warrants, Chevy trucks) and themes of regret and defiance, but the tempo and instrumentation (electric guitars, kick drum) give it a rocker’s edge, appealing to fans of both classic and modern country. Phrasing: The Bye Bye Birdie-inspired short, rhythmic lines (“Run from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in”) remain, delivered with a conversational, almost frantic cadence that suits the chase narrative and keeps the song catchy. Mainstream Potential: The driving beat, anthemic chorus, and cinematic vibe give it crossover appeal, similar to high-energy country hits that blend outlaw grit with radio-ready hooks. Sound::\nVibe: The song feels like a high-stakes escape, with the reaper as both a literal and metaphorical pursuer. It’s gritty enough for purists but polished enough for a broader audience, with a sound that could fit a modern country festival or a film soundtrack. Performance: Envision this in a smoky roadhouse or a dramatic musical scene, with a rugged singer in a leather jacket, backed by a tight band (electric guitar, banjo, pedal steel, drums). The chorus could ignite a crowd to stomp and sing along, while the bridge offers a moment of raw intensity. Imagery and Themes: The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a fugitive’s life—dusty trails, flashing lights, burning bridges—while hinting at redemption, keeping the emotional depth intact.",
