      "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nI’m sittin’ at this barstool, with a neon glow,\nPourin’ out my heartache, where the jukebox flows.\nThe bartender knows me, he don’t ask my name,\nJust slides another whiskey, to kill the pain.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThis dive bar’s my church, where the sinners pray,\nSpillin’ out their stories, till the break of day.\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Verse 2)\nThe gal I loved, she’s gone, took my ramblin’ heart,\nLeft me with this bottle, and a brand-new scar.\nBut this amber fire, it don’t judge my sins,\nJust lights up the shadows, where my night begins.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe jukebox is wailin’, but it can’t compare,\nTo the truth in this glass, and the pain we share.\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Bridge)\nSo here’s to the lost, and the ones we miss,\nTo the fights and the nights, sealed with a kiss.\nEvery drop’s a preacher, every sip’s a song,\nSing it with me, brothers, we’ll howl all night long!\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Outro)\nWhen the barroom’s empty, and the stars burn low,\nI’ll stumble to the highway, with nowhere to go.\nBut I’ll carry this gospel, till the day I die,\nSing it one more time—whiskey don’t lie!\nYeah, whiskey don’t lie! (Raise ‘em up high!)\nWhiskey don’t lie!\nAcoustic sound: A stripped-down, raw acoustic arrangement with a steady strumming pattern highlights the song's heartache, while a mournful fiddle weaves in and out, emphasizing the lament. The vocal delivery is gritty and vulnerable, carrying the story's emotional weight with a conversational honesty.\nPotential Sound:\nOutlaw Country Vibe: The song channels the raw, rebellious spirit of outlaw country with vivid imagery (neon, jukeboxes, barstools) and a narrator who’s both broken and defiant. The whiskey serves as a metaphor for unfiltered truth, tying into the genre’s honesty. Singalong Energy: The repetitive chorus (“Whiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight”) and simple, anthemic hooks are designed for a crowd to shout along, with gang vocals and a bridge that rallies everyone to join in. Modern Touches: References to phones or modern heartbreak are subtle, keeping the focus on timeless barroom camaraderie, but the tone feels relatable for 2025. Performance: Picture this in a sweaty honky-tonk or a modern country musical, with a charismatic frontman leading a raucous band (electric guitar, fiddle, piano, drums). The crowd stomps boots, clinks bottles, and sings the chorus at the top of their lungs.",

(Keep on runnin’ free.)\nComin’ for me.\nAcoustic sound: A raw, heart-pounding acoustic ballad with an urgent, mid-tempo pulse blends stripped-down vulnerability with fierce intensity, anchored by driving guitar and weathered, urgent vocals that evoke a high-stakes personal journey.\nPotential Sound:\nA high-octane outlaw country rocker with a driving, mid-to-up-tempo pulse, blending gritty authenticity with cinematic intensity. Anchored by twangy electric guitars and a relentless acoustic strum, the track pulses with a galloping kick drum and a deep, rumbling bassline, evoking a fugitive’s desperate ride. A searing pedal steel wail and occasional banjo plucks add raw country soul, while sparse harmonica stabs heighten the tension. The vocal delivery is weathered and urgent, with gritty, conversational phrasing and subtle backing harmonies that carry a ghostly edge. The tone is rebellious, desperate, and vivid, conjuring a lone outlaw tearing through a desert under a blood-red sky, perfect for a high-stakes Western chase scene, a modern country musical climax, or a road-trip playlist staple.\nWhy It’s Not a Ballad:\nTempo and Energy: The song now has a faster, driving rhythm, with a galloping beat and urgent guitar riffs that evoke a chase rather than a slow, mournful ballad. The energy is high, pushing the narrative forward like a fugitive on the run. Outlaw Country Core: It retains the genre’s raw storytelling, with vivid imagery (dusty roads, warrants, Chevy trucks) and themes of regret and defiance, but the tempo and instrumentation (electric guitars, kick drum) give it a rocker’s edge, appealing to fans of both classic and modern country. Phrasing: The Bye Bye Birdie-inspired short, rhythmic lines (“Run from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in”) remain, delivered with a conversational, almost frantic cadence that suits the chase narrative and keeps the song catchy. Mainstream Potential: The driving beat, anthemic chorus, and cinematic vibe give it crossover appeal, similar to high-energy country hits that blend outlaw grit with radio-ready hooks. Sound::\nVibe: The song feels like a high-stakes escape, with the reaper as both a literal and metaphorical pursuer. It’s gritty enough for purists but polished enough for a broader audience, with a sound that could fit a modern country festival or a film soundtrack. Performance: Envision this in a smoky roadhouse or a dramatic musical scene, with a rugged singer in a leather jacket, backed by a tight band (electric guitar, banjo, pedal steel, drums). The chorus could ignite a crowd to stomp and sing along, while the bridge offers a moment of raw intensity. Imagery and Themes: The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a fugitive’s life—dusty trails, flashing lights, burning bridges—while hinting at redemption, keeping the emotional depth intact.",

Performance: Picture the artist in a leather jacket, commanding a stage with a band (electric guitar, banjo, pedal steel, fiddle). The chorus sparks crowd chants, and the bridge could feature a dramatic guitar solo or vocal wail. For TikTok/busking, an acoustic version would rely on fierce strumming and raw vocals.
