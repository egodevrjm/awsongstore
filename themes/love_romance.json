You're gone, my darlin', chasin' some new flame, But my heart's still ramblin', callin' out your name.\n(Pre-Chorus) This whiskey's cold, it don't ease the pain, Without you here, I'm half insane.\n(Chorus) When you can't be near me, oh, my lonesome soul, Keep me in your rearview, where the heartaches roll.

Got your voice in my head, like a steel guitar's cry, Keeps me holdin' on, beneath this empty sky.\n(Pre-Chorus) The barstool's creakin', but it ain't my home, Without your touch, I'm destined to roam.\n(Chorus) When you can't be near me, oh, my lonesome soul, Keep me in your rearview, where the heartaches roll. Sing my name like a jukebox, broken, wild, and free, When you can't be near me, please think of me.\n(Bridge) So raise a glass, wherever you ride, Send a prayer on the wind, to the lonesome side. We'll cross paths again, down some dusty road, Till then, I'm carryin' this heavy load.\n(Chorus) When you can't be near me, oh, my lonesome soul, Keep me in your rearview, where the heartaches roll. Sing my name like a jukebox, broken, wild, and free, When you can't be near me, please think of me.\n(Outro) So when you're out there, under neon's glow, I'm still your rebel, in the shadows, you know. Till we're back together, where we're meant to be, When you can't be near me... please think of me. Yeah, think of me. (Oh, my lonesome soul.) Think of me.",

      "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nI’m sittin’ at this barstool, with a neon glow,\nPourin’ out my heartache, where the jukebox flows.\nThe bartender knows me, he don’t ask my name,\nJust slides another whiskey, to kill the pain.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThis dive bar’s my church, where the sinners pray,\nSpillin’ out their stories, till the break of day.\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Verse 2)\nThe gal I loved, she’s gone, took my ramblin’ heart,\nLeft me with this bottle, and a brand-new scar.\nBut this amber fire, it don’t judge my sins,\nJust lights up the shadows, where my night begins.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe jukebox is wailin’, but it can’t compare,\nTo the truth in this glass, and the pain we share.\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Bridge)\nSo here’s to the lost, and the ones we miss,\nTo the fights and the nights, sealed with a kiss.\nEvery drop’s a preacher, every sip’s a song,\nSing it with me, brothers, we’ll howl all night long!\n(Chorus)\nWhiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight,\nBurns like the truth, no need to wait!\nRaise your glass high, let the heartache fly,\nSing it loud, boys, whiskey don’t lie!\n(Outro)\nWhen the barroom’s empty, and the stars burn low,\nI’ll stumble to the highway, with nowhere to go.\nBut I’ll carry this gospel, till the day I die,\nSing it one more time—whiskey don’t lie!\nYeah, whiskey don’t lie! (Raise ‘em up high!)\nWhiskey don’t lie!\nAcoustic sound: A stripped-down, raw acoustic arrangement with a steady strumming pattern highlights the song's heartache, while a mournful fiddle weaves in and out, emphasizing the lament. The vocal delivery is gritty and vulnerable, carrying the story's emotional weight with a conversational honesty.\nPotential Sound:\nOutlaw Country Vibe: The song channels the raw, rebellious spirit of outlaw country with vivid imagery (neon, jukeboxes, barstools) and a narrator who’s both broken and defiant. The whiskey serves as a metaphor for unfiltered truth, tying into the genre’s honesty. Singalong Energy: The repetitive chorus (“Whiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight”) and simple, anthemic hooks are designed for a crowd to shout along, with gang vocals and a bridge that rallies everyone to join in. Modern Touches: References to phones or modern heartbreak are subtle, keeping the focus on timeless barroom camaraderie, but the tone feels relatable for 2025. Performance: Picture this in a sweaty honky-tonk or a modern country musical, with a charismatic frontman leading a raucous band (electric guitar, fiddle, piano, drums). The crowd stomps boots, clinks bottles, and sings the chorus at the top of their lungs.",

(Tumbleweed dreams.)\nRollin’ along.\nVibe: The song feels like a late-night drive through a desert, with the narrator grappling with his transient life and lingering hope. It’s less intense than \"Reaper\" but equally compelling, with a balance of grit and melody. Performance: Picture the same artist performing this in a dimly lit roadhouse or on a festival stage, strumming a worn guitar with a band (acoustic, electric, pedal steel, harmonica). The chorus invites quiet singalongs, and the bridge could feature a spotlight on the singer’s raw delivery. Imagery and Themes: Lyrics evoke rural, transient life (diners, highways, tumbleweeds) while touching on universal emotions (love, regret, hope), making it relatable yet authentically country.\nSounds Like\nA soulful, mid-tempo outlaw country anthem with a reflective, road-worn vibe, blending gritty authenticity with radio-friendly hooks.",
