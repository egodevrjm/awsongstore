Got your voice in my head, like a steel guitar's cry, Keeps me holdin' on, beneath this empty sky.\n(Pre-Chorus) The barstool's creakin', but it ain't my home, Without your touch, I'm destined to roam.\n(Chorus) When you can't be near me, oh, my lonesome soul, Keep me in your rearview, where the heartaches roll. Sing my name like a jukebox, broken, wild, and free, When you can't be near me, please think of me.\n(Bridge) So raise a glass, wherever you ride, Send a prayer on the wind, to the lonesome side. We'll cross paths again, down some dusty road, Till then, I'm carryin' this heavy load.\n(Chorus) When you can't be near me, oh, my lonesome soul, Keep me in your rearview, where the heartaches roll. Sing my name like a jukebox, broken, wild, and free, When you can't be near me, please think of me.\n(Outro) So when you're out there, under neon's glow, I'm still your rebel, in the shadows, you know. Till we're back together, where we're meant to be, When you can't be near me... please think of me. Yeah, think of me. (Oh, my lonesome soul.) Think of me.",

(Raise ‘em up high!)\nWhiskey don’t lie!\nAcoustic sound: A stripped-down, raw acoustic arrangement with a steady strumming pattern highlights the song's heartache, while a mournful fiddle weaves in and out, emphasizing the lament. The vocal delivery is gritty and vulnerable, carrying the story's emotional weight with a conversational honesty.\nPotential Sound:\nOutlaw Country Vibe: The song channels the raw, rebellious spirit of outlaw country with vivid imagery (neon, jukeboxes, barstools) and a narrator who’s both broken and defiant. The whiskey serves as a metaphor for unfiltered truth, tying into the genre’s honesty. Singalong Energy: The repetitive chorus (“Whiskey don’t lie, it tells it straight”) and simple, anthemic hooks are designed for a crowd to shout along, with gang vocals and a bridge that rallies everyone to join in. Modern Touches: References to phones or modern heartbreak are subtle, keeping the focus on timeless barroom camaraderie, but the tone feels relatable for 2025. Performance: Picture this in a sweaty honky-tonk or a modern country musical, with a charismatic frontman leading a raucous band (electric guitar, fiddle, piano, drums). The crowd stomps boots, clinks bottles, and sings the chorus at the top of their lungs.",

(Keep on runnin’ free.)\nComin’ for me.\nAcoustic sound: A raw, heart-pounding acoustic ballad with an urgent, mid-tempo pulse blends stripped-down vulnerability with fierce intensity, anchored by driving guitar and weathered, urgent vocals that evoke a high-stakes personal journey.\nPotential Sound:\nA high-octane outlaw country rocker with a driving, mid-to-up-tempo pulse, blending gritty authenticity with cinematic intensity. Anchored by twangy electric guitars and a relentless acoustic strum, the track pulses with a galloping kick drum and a deep, rumbling bassline, evoking a fugitive’s desperate ride. A searing pedal steel wail and occasional banjo plucks add raw country soul, while sparse harmonica stabs heighten the tension. The vocal delivery is weathered and urgent, with gritty, conversational phrasing and subtle backing harmonies that carry a ghostly edge. The tone is rebellious, desperate, and vivid, conjuring a lone outlaw tearing through a desert under a blood-red sky, perfect for a high-stakes Western chase scene, a modern country musical climax, or a road-trip playlist staple.\nWhy It’s Not a Ballad:\nTempo and Energy: The song now has a faster, driving rhythm, with a galloping beat and urgent guitar riffs that evoke a chase rather than a slow, mournful ballad. The energy is high, pushing the narrative forward like a fugitive on the run. Outlaw Country Core: It retains the genre’s raw storytelling, with vivid imagery (dusty roads, warrants, Chevy trucks) and themes of regret and defiance, but the tempo and instrumentation (electric guitars, kick drum) give it a rocker’s edge, appealing to fans of both classic and modern country. Phrasing: The Bye Bye Birdie-inspired short, rhythmic lines (“Run from the reaper, but he’s closin’ in”) remain, delivered with a conversational, almost frantic cadence that suits the chase narrative and keeps the song catchy. Mainstream Potential: The driving beat, anthemic chorus, and cinematic vibe give it crossover appeal, similar to high-energy country hits that blend outlaw grit with radio-ready hooks. Sound::\nVibe: The song feels like a high-stakes escape, with the reaper as both a literal and metaphorical pursuer. It’s gritty enough for purists but polished enough for a broader audience, with a sound that could fit a modern country festival or a film soundtrack. Performance: Envision this in a smoky roadhouse or a dramatic musical scene, with a rugged singer in a leather jacket, backed by a tight band (electric guitar, banjo, pedal steel, drums). The chorus could ignite a crowd to stomp and sing along, while the bridge offers a moment of raw intensity. Imagery and Themes: The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a fugitive’s life—dusty trails, flashing lights, burning bridges—while hinting at redemption, keeping the emotional depth intact.",

      "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nSixteen summers bleedin' into fall,\nDaddy's shadow stretched across the wall.\nHis words like whiskey, burnin' down my throat,\nKicked me out to wander, wearin' a thin coat.\nPikeville hollers echoed with my shame,\nInnocence a flicker, dyin' in the flame.\n\n(Verse 2)\nFound a floor to sleep on, kindness in a stranger's eye,\nBut the mountain cold seeped in, beneath a starless sky.\nTraded school books for a pick and shovel's weight,\nCoal dust settled on my dreams, sealin' up their fate.\nThis broken arm, a constant ache, a twisted memory,\nOf a boy who used to dream beneath a dogwood tree.\n\n(Chorus)\nCoal dust on the lamb, a stain that won't come clean,\nLost my way back home, a forgotten, faded scene.\nThese coal-stained hands, they hold the weight of sin,\nPrayin' for redemption, hopin' God lets me in.\n\n(Verse 3)\nSunrise paints the mountain ridge, a fiery, bloody hue,\nAnother day of breakin' back, another debt to accrue.\nThe fields stretch out before me, endless rows of green,\nBut all I see is darkness, a fractured, broken scene.\nThis ain't the life I pictured,  beneath the mountain's gaze,\nJust a broken boy, lost in a lonely, hazy maze.\n\n(Bridge)\nMama's hymnals echo, a whisper in the wind,\nA memory of comfort, a peace I can't pretend.\nWill I ever feel that grace again, that gentle, lovin' hand?\nOr am I destined to wander, a ghost in this promised land?\n\n(Chorus)\nCoal dust on the lamb, a stain that won't come clean,\nLost my way back home, a forgotten, faded scene.\nThese coal-stained hands, they hold the weight of sin,\nPrayin' for redemption, hopin' God lets me in.\n\n(Outro)\nLord, have mercy, on this coal-stained soul,\nLead me back to the fold, make me whole. \nMake me whole.",
