  "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nBorn in the shadow of a rusted cage,\nCoal dust scars and a heart’s old rage.\nWords stayed locked where the hurt runs deep,\nWhispers in the dark were mine to keep.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nVerse 2:\nNights on the mountain, just me and the wind,\nStrummed my pain where the pines don’t end.\nEach string I broke was a chain let go,\nTruth came alive where the quiet grows.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nBridge:\nNo crowd, no stage, just a heart laid bare,\nSang to the stars ‘cause they always cared.\nThe hurt runs deep, but the truth runs free,\nSilence taught the song that’s savin’ me.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nOutro:\nNow I sing my truth, let the echoes fly,\nBorn in the silence ‘neath a Kentucky sky.\nYou gotta walk through silence, let it break you loose,\nTo find the song that’s livin’ in your truth.",

  "notes": "Acoustic Version Sound Description:\nSetting: Imagine Alex sitting on the tailgate of his truck, parked on a bluff overlooking LA at dusk, his rusted guitar in hand, playing for Shay or just the wind, as he often does. The performance is raw, unamplified, and deeply personal, reflecting his self-taught, solitary style.\nSound:\n•  Guitar: The rusted guitar, with its slightly out-of-tune strings, produces a gritty, resonant tone. Alex uses open chords (G, C, D, Am) with a slow, deliberate strumming pattern, letting each note ring out. The verse has a sparse, fingerpicked intro, transitioning to a fuller strum in the chorus for emotional weight. The bridge softens to a near-whisper, with single-string plucks emphasizing vulnerability.\n•  Vocals: Alex’s voice is gravelly and unpolished, like Chris Stapleton after a long night, carrying the weight of his Pikeville scars. He sings low and measured in the verses, letting the lyrics’ pain breathe. The chorus builds with a raw intensity, his voice cracking slightly on “sing the truth,” conveying survival. The outro fades with a softer, almost spoken delivery, like a prayer.\n•  Arrangement: No backing instruments—just Alex and his guitar. The tempo is moderate (around 80 BPM), with natural pauses after “silence” in the chorus, mimicking the quiet he sings about. The song’s dynamic shifts come from his voice and strumming intensity, peaking in the bridge and easing in the outro.\n•  Atmosphere: The performance feels intimate, like a confession. The guitar’s imperfections (a faint buzz on the low E string) and Alex’s unrefined vocals mirror his life’s roughness. Background sounds—crickets, a distant LA hum—blend into the song, grounding it in the moment. It’s the kind of performance that makes Shay’s eyes well up, hearing his truth laid bare.\nVibe: Think Johnny Cash’s Hurt (acoustic cover) meets Tyler Childers’ Feathered Indians—raw, haunting, and deeply felt, with no need for polish. It’s Alex at his core, singing to process his past, not to perform."
