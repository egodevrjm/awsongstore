  "status": "private",
  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nUp on the bluff where the wild winds sing,\nStrummed my old guitar, let my heartstrings ring.\nSang to the stars, just me and the night,\nNever thought my songs would catch fire online.\n\nChorus\nNow they say I’m goin’ viral, whatever that might mean,\nLittle screens all lit up, craziest thing I’ve seen!\nSingin’ ‘bout Georgia and the Devil’s dance,\nJust a bluff-top dreamer takin’ one wild chance!\n\nVerse 2\nCrowd packed tight at the town’s old bar,\nHollered I’d get nekked, pushed it just too far.\nFiddle screamed hot, ‘bout the Devil and the deal,\nWhole place roared, felt the floorboards reel.\n\nChorus\nNow they say I’m goin’ viral, whatever that might mean,\nLittle screens all lit up, craziest thing I’ve seen!\nSingin’ ‘bout Georgia and the Devil’s dance,\nJust a bluff-top dreamer takin’ one wild chance!\n\nBridge\nAin’t no stage I planned, just truth in my soul,\nSongs from the heart made the whole world roll.\nFrom a lonesome wind to a million views,\nGuess my voice sparked fire in folks’ old boots!\n\nChorus\nNow they say I’m goin’ viral, whatever that might mean,\nLittle screens all lit up, craziest thing I’ve seen!\nSingin’ ‘bout Georgia and the Devil’s dance,\nJust a bluff-top dreamer takin’ one wild chance!\n\nOutro\n(Claps, hollers, fiddle wails)\nYeah, goin’ viral, still don’t know the score,\nJust me and my songs, and that bluff’s wild roar!",
