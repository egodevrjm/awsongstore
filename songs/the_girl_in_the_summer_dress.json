  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nShe sauntered in the diner, with a devilish sway,\nThat summer dress clingin’ in a dangerous way.\nOne wink over coffee, set my pulse to a race,\nGod makes the good stuff, and she owned that space.\nChorus\nOne look, one laugh, and the sparks flew free,\nA jolt of pure trouble meant just for me.\nHer touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,\nThe girl in the summer dress took full control.\nVerse 2\nShe leaned in real close, stole my shades with a grin,\nHer whisper was velvet, brushed like fire on my skin.\nShe danced with a swagger, left my heart in a bind,\nOne graze of her fingers, and I lost my damn mind.\nChorus\nOne look, one laugh, and the sparks flew free,\nA jolt of pure trouble meant just for me.\nHer touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,\nThe girl in the summer dress took full control.\nBridge\nNow the diner’s too tame, but her heat lingers on,\nThat mischievous glint in her eyes ain’t gone.\nI toast to the thrill, to the game that she played,\nOne taste of her magic, and my night was made.\nFinal Chorus\nOne look, one laugh, and I’m still feelin’ wild,\nA flash of her fire keeps this cowboy beguiled.\nHer touch was a tease, but it lit up my soul,\nThe girl in the summer dress—God, she was bold.",
