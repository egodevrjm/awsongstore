  "lyrics": "Verse\nDaddy’s yellin’ loud, his hands they hurt me so,\nI hide under my bed, where the shadows grow.\nBottle’s on the floor, it’s breakin’ up our home,\nI’m scared and all alone, wishin’ he’d be gone.\nChorus\nMama, make him stop, please make him go away,\nI’m prayin’ through my tears, for a brighter day.\nMama, hear my song, I’m beggin’ you to try,\nMake him stop the hurt, so I don’t have to cry.",
