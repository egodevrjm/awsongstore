  "status": "private",
  "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nBorn in the shadow of a rusted cage,\nCoal dust scars and a heart’s old rage.\nWords stayed locked where the hurt runs deep,\nWhispers in the dark were mine to keep.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nVerse 2:\nNights on the mountain, just me and the wind,\nStrummed my pain where the pines don’t end.\nEach string I broke was a chain let go,\nTruth came alive where the quiet grows.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nBridge:\nNo crowd, no stage, just a heart laid bare,\nSang to the stars ‘cause they always cared.\nThe hurt runs deep, but the truth runs free,\nSilence taught the song that’s savin’ me.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nOutro:\nNow I sing my truth, let the echoes fly,\nBorn in the silence ‘neath a Kentucky sky.\nYou gotta walk through silence, let it break you loose,\nTo find the song that’s livin’ in your truth.",

  "sounds_like_acoustic": "This pure country ballad opens with warm fingerpicked acoustic guitar, gently layered with upright bass, Subtle strings swell underneath, adding depth, while brushed snare and soft percussion keep time, Spacious, melancholic reverb enhances the arrangement, highlighting each instrumental nuance",
