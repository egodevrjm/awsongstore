  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nIn the hollow where the river bends,\nA whisper fights the wind’s old trends.\nIt claws at the silence, sharp as a knife,\nBeggin’ to sing, but it fears the light.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe crows keep circlin’, they know my name,\nCallin’ me out, but I dodge the flame.\n(Chorus)\nShadow’s holler, screamin’ through the pines,\nCarries my truth, where the moonlight shines.\nIt roars in the dark, but it hides from the day,\nShadow’s holler, got too much to say.\n(Verse 2)\nThere’s a fire in the valley, burnin’ deep and low,\nWords carved in my bones, that the river knows.\nThey churn like a current, wild and untamed,\nBut the spotlight’s a hunter, and I’m the game.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThose black wings hover, they won’t let me be,\nUrgin’ me loud, but I long to stay free.\n(Chorus)\nShadow’s holler, screamin’ through the pines,\nCarries my truth, where the moonlight shines.\nIt roars in the dark, but it hides from the day,\nShadow’s holler, got too much to say.\n(Bridge)\nI’ve seen the stage’s glow, a siren’s call,\nPromisin’ glory, but it takes it all.\nYet the echo in my chest, it won’t stay still,\nLike a ghost in the canyon, it’s hauntin’ me still.\n(Chorus)\nShadow’s holler, screamin’ through the pines,\nCarries my truth, where the moonlight shines.\nIt roars in the dark, but it hides from the day,\nShadow’s holler, got too much to say.\n(Outro)\nSo I’ll sing to the shadows, where the wild things roam,\nLet the river carry my heart back home.\nIn the quiet of the night, my truth’ll still fly,\nShadow’s holler, under a lonesome sky.\nYeah, shadow’s holler… forever I’ll hide.\nVibe: The song feels like a late-night confession in a pine forest, balancing the songwriter’s hidden truth with a universal yearning for expression. It’s introspective yet anthemic, fitting for both a dive bar and a festival stage. Performance: Picture the rugged artist in a flannel, strumming under stage lights with a band (acoustic, electric, pedal steel, banjo). The chorus invites quiet singalongs, and the bridge offers a raw, spotlight moment. For TikTok or busking, an acoustic version would emphasize the guitar’s twang and the vocals’ grit. Appeal: The allegorical storytelling and emotional depth resonate with country purists, while the melody and production could catch mainstream ears, potentially climbing charts or going viral on social media.\nSounds Like\nA mid-tempo outlaw country anthem with a brooding, soulful edge, blending gritty authenticity with mainstream polish for radio and festival appeal. Anchored by a twangy acoustic guitar’s rhythmic strum and a haunting electric guitar riff, the track pulses with a steady kick drum and a deep, rolling bassline. A mournful pedal steel weaves through the verses, while subtle banjo plucks and a distant harmonica wail in the bridge add rural depth. The vocal delivery is raw, emotive, and slightly weathered, with conversational phrasing and soaring harmonies that lift the chorus into an anthemic cry. The tone is introspective, yearning, and allegorical, evoking a lone songwriter wrestling with his truth under a moonlit pine forest, perfect for a modern country playlist, a cinematic drama, or a heartfelt live performance.",
