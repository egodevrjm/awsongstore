  "lyrics": "Title:  Wildflower Heart\n(Verse 1)\nGrandma's china, chipped and worn\nSitting pretty on a shelf, a life adorned\nWith stories whispered, dreams untold\nA legacy of strength, a heart of gold\nBut I wasn't born for porcelain and lace\nThis restless spirit needed open space\nTo find my own voice, my own design\nA different kind of beauty, a wilder vine\n(Chorus)\nI'm a wildflower heart, blooming late\nReaching for the sun, defying fate\nBreaking free from fences, painted white\nDancing in the moonlight, bathed in silver light\nI'm a wildflower heart, finally free\nThis untamed spirit, that's the real me\n(Verse 2)\nMama's wisdom, etched in lines\nOn her hands that worked, through sun and shine\nShe taught me kindness, grace, and how to pray\nBut sometimes silence stole my words away\nI traded whispers for a roaring sound\nMy roots ran deeper in unturned ground\nWhere shadows danced and secrets grew\nAnd I discovered truths, mama never knew\n(Bridge)\nMaybe it's the wind that carries seeds of change\nAcross the generations, rearranging\nThe patterns of our lives, the paths we roam\nUntil we finally find our way back home\nTo the heart that beats within, wild and strong\nWhere we belong, where we've belonged all along\n(Chorus)\nI'm a wildflower heart, blooming late\nReaching for the sun, defying fate\nBreaking free from fences, painted white\nDancing in the moonlight, bathed in silver light\nI'm a wildflower heart, finally free\nThis untamed spirit, that's the real me\n(Outro)\nYeah, this wildflower heart, it's finally free\nBlooming bright, for everyone to see\nThis untamed spirit, that's the real me\nThe real me.",
