  "status": "private",
  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nBack alley shadows, where the drunks lose their way,\nFound a splintered old box in the trash’s decay.\nSix rusted strings, neck warped like my dreams,\nBut it hummed like a savior in the moonlight’s beams.\nPre-Chorus\nNo angels in this town, just coal and despair,\nBut that guitar called my name through the cold, bitter air.\nChorus\nHeard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,\nA broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.\nThis dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,\nFound the song that saved my life right there inside of you.\nVerse 2\nDad’s fists were thunder, his bottle was king,\nBut I strummed my first chord, felt my heart start to sing.\nHid it in the shed where his eyes wouldn’t roam,\nEach note was a fire that was callin’ me home.\nPre-Chorus\nNo preacher could reach me, no sermon could mend,\nBut that guitar was my truth, my beginning, my friend.\nChorus\nHeard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,\nA broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.\nThis dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,\nFound the song that saved my life right there inside of you.\nBridge\nEvery scratch was a story, every crack was a fight,\nI coaxed out my soul in the dead of the night.\nFrom a boy lost in silence to a man with a voice,\nThis guitar was my freedom, my heart’s only choice.\nChorus\nHeard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust,\nA broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.\nThis dumpster guitar salvation, ragged but it’s true,\nFound the song that saved my life right there inside of you.\nOutro\n*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*\nDumpster guitar… still singin’ me through.",
