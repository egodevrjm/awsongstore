  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nGravel lot’s kickin’ up dust in the glow,\nJukebox blarin’ where the wild ones go.\nBoots stomp hard to a Haggard tune,\nNeon’s hummin’ under a Kentucky moon.\nPre-Chorus\nTailgates down beneath neon haze,\nSpilt laughter echoin’ neon blaze,\nWe chased release through Friday’s maze.\nChorus\nTailgates down, radios loud,\nFreedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.\nRaise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,\nFind Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.\nVerse 2\nShe’s dancin’ close, with a spark in her grin,\nLeather and denim, pullin’ me in.\nCold beer sweats in a red solo cup,\nWe’re livin’ for now, never givin’ up.\nPre-Chorus\nTailgates down beneath neon haze,\nSpilt laughter echoin’ neon blaze,\nWe chased release through Friday’s maze.\nChorus\nTailgates down, radios loud,\nFreedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.\nRaise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,\nFind Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.\nBridge\nFiddle screams high, cuttin’ through the night,\nEvery chord’s a spark, settin’ hearts alight.\nWe’re rebels and dreamers, breakin’ every chain,\nBaptized in the chaos, washed clean by the flame.\nChorus\nTailgates down, radios loud,\nFreedom tastes better when you’re lost in the crowd.\nRaise hell, raise hope, raise hands to the sky,\nFind Saturday night salvation before Monday dries.\nPost-Chorus\nDrunk on music, bruised by dawn’s light,\nWe stumble home from wild delight,\nHearts baptized in the endless night.\n**Outro** (Fiddle run: G|-3-5-7-5-3-0-|)\nStars fade slow, but we’re holdin’ on tight,\nLivin’ for the rush of a Saturday night.",
