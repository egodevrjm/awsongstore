  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nYour name’s a bruise I wore like a brand,\nCarved in my bones by your heavy hand.\nA house full of echoes, a heart full of rust,\nYou left me your anger, but never your trust.\nPre-Chorus\nI walked through your fire, I carried your blame,\nBut I’m done bendin’ under your cursed last name.\nChorus\nA hollow house, a heavy name —\nI carry your lessons and your shame.\nBut you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —\nI’m not just what Dad left behind.\nVerse 2\nYour whiskey-soaked rants were my lullaby,\nEach swing of your fist was a reason to try.\nI built my own road from the wreckage you made,\nTurned your broken legacy to a debt I’ve repaid.\nPre-Chorus\nI fought through your darkness, I found my own light,\nI’m claimin’ my freedom in the dead of the night.\nChorus\nA hollow house, a heavy name —\nI carry your lessons and your shame.\nBut you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —\nI’m not just what Dad left behind.\nBridge\nEvery scar’s a story, every fight’s a song,\nI’m stronger for the pain you heaped on so long.\nYour ghost don’t own me, I’m cuttin’ the ties,\nI’m risin’ above what Dad left in his lies.\nChorus\nA hollow house, a heavy name —\nI carry your lessons and your shame.\nBut you can’t chain down a storm or a mind —\nI’m not just what Dad left behind.\nOutro\n*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*\nNot just what Dad left behind… I’m free.",
