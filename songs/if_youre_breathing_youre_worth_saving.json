  "lyrics": "If You’re Breathing, You’re Worth Saving\nVerse 1\nDust motes dancing in the faded light\nOf a single bulb hanging low tonight\nEmpty bottle whispers stories untold\nAnother heart grown weary and old\nHe sits and stares at the cracked window pane\nRain streaks down like tears, washing away the stain\nOf a life lived hard, a path gone astray\nLost in the shadows, afraid of the day\nChorus\nBut if you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nA flicker of hope in the darkness waving\nEven when the whispers tell you you’re done\nThere’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won\nIf you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nDon’t let the shadows keep you from craving\nThe light that’s within, the strength you possess\nRise from the ashes, find your blessedness\nVerse 2\nShe walks the streets with her head held down\nInvisible wounds in this bustling town\nA silent scream trapped behind her eyes\nLost in the echoes of a thousand lies\nCarries the weight of a broken promise made\nA fractured dream that slowly decayed\nShe searches for solace, a hand to hold tight\nA beacon of hope in the darkest of night\nChorus\nBut if you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nA flicker of hope in the darkness waving\nEven when the whispers tell you you’re done\nThere’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won\nIf you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nDon’t let the shadows keep you from craving\nThe light that’s within, the strength you possess\nRise from the ashes, find your blessedness\nBridge\nThe world may judge you, may turn away its face\nBut grace finds its way to the most desolate place\nDon’t give up now, there’s still time to mend\nA broken heart can learn to love again\nChorus\nIf you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nA flicker of hope in the darkness waving\nEven when the whispers tell you you’re done\nThere’s a sunrise waiting, a battle to be won\nIf you’re breathing, you’re worth saving\nDon’t let the shadows keep you from craving\nThe light that’s within, the strength you possess\nRise from the ashes, find your blessedness\nOutro\nIf you’re breathing… you’re worth saving…\nYou’re worth saving…\nYou’re worth saving…",
