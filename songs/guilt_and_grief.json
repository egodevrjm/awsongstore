  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nNever heard your voice, never felt your touch,\nJust a gravestone whisper in a mining town clutch.\nThey say I stole your breath when I took my first,\nNow I carry that weight like a lifelong curse.\nPre-Chorus\nI’d trade all my tomorrows for one yesterday,\nTo know the love you never got to say.\nChorus\nI dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —\nA cradle of silence, a story untold.\nI carry your voice in the spaces he left —\nGuilt and grief are all I have left.\nVerse 2\nDad’s eyes were daggers, blamin’ me for your end,\nBut I’d see you in dreams where my heart could mend.\nYour shadow’s my shelter when the nights get mean,\nI’m holdin’ onto love I’ve only ever seen.\nPre-Chorus\nI’d give all my songs for one moment with you,\nTo feel what a mother’s arms can do.\nChorus\nI dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —\nA cradle of silence, a story untold.\nI carry your voice in the spaces he left —\nGuilt and grief are all I have left.\nBridge\nEvery chord I play is a prayer to your name,\nEvery tear I hide is a candle’s flame.\nYou’re gone, but you’re woven in my every breath,\nI’m livin’ through the guilt to honor your death.\nChorus\nI dreamt of your hands, but I woke up cold —\nA cradle of silence, a story untold.\nI carry your voice in the spaces he left —\nGuilt and grief are all I have left.\nOutro\n*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*\nGuilt and grief… my heart’s only theft.",
