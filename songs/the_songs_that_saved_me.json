  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nIn a trailer’s shadow, where the silence screamed,\nFound a rusted guitar, chased a broken dream.\nJohnny’s voice of hurt cut through my pain,\nWaylon’s rebel soul kept me sane.\n\nChorus\nSongs that saved me, pullin’ me through,\nTruth in the darkness, love that’s true.\nFrom the grave’s cold call to a heart’s soft plea,\nThese old songs, they’re savin’ me.\n\nVerse 2\nStapleton’s gravel wrapped my scars in grace,\nChilders sang the hills where I found my place.\nAdele’s fire burned my doubts away,\nEach note a light in my lonesome day.\n\nChorus\nSongs that saved me, pullin’ me through,\nTruth in the darkness, love that’s true.\nFrom the grave’s cold call to a heart’s soft plea,\nThese old songs, they’re savin’ me.\n\nBridge\n“Hurt” taught me wounds can sing out loud,\n“Cover Me Up” showed love’s the proudest sound.\n“O Death” whispered life’s a fleeting flame,\nTheir truths carved my heart, gave me my name.\n\nChorus\nSongs that saved me, pullin’ me through,\nTruth in the darkness, love that’s true.\nFrom the grave’s cold call to a heart’s soft plea,\nThese old songs, they’re savin’ me.\n\nOutro\nNow I strum my truth ‘neath a lonesome sky,\nCarryin’ their echoes till the day I die.\nThrough the pain and love, their voices I see,\nThese old songs, forever savin’ me.",

  "sounds_like_acoustic": "Jangly acoustic guitar sets the upbeat pace, joined by twangy electric riffs and thumping drums, Banjo and lively fiddle interweave through verses and choruses, while tambourine and organ add energy, Alex’s raspy vocals soar atop rich group harmonies, creating a polished, radio-ready anthem",
