  "lyrics": "Hollow Turns Hallelujah\nVerse 1\nBoot prints fading, desert moon hanging low\nGuard duty whispers, stories we all know\nChopper blades turning, a melancholic drone\nThe campfire's out, brothers gone, too soon flown\nVerse 2\nWe built our bunkers, sandbags stacked up high\nDreamed of homecomings 'neath a foreign sky\nShared our rations, stories raw and true\nNow the echoes fade, a future we couldn't view\nChorus\nBut the hollow turns hallelujah, in the quiet of the years\nA symphony of service, washed away by bittersweet tears\nWe raise our voices, cracked and worn, a campfire choir once more\nSingin' hymns of resilience, from the scars that we bore\nVerse 3\nRifle shots echo, a bugle out of tune\nForgotten faces flicker beneath the desert moon\nThe camaraderie lingers, a ghost in the desert air\nA reminder of courage, a burden that we share\nBridge\nWe scattered like shrapnel, on the winds of war we flew\nChasing a mission's purpose, some lost, some seeing it through\nBut the bonds run deep, beneath the surface they reside\nBound by the campfire's glow, where our brothers' spirits abide\nChorus\nAnd the hollow turns hallelujah, in the quiet of the years\nA symphony of service, washed away by bittersweet tears\nWe raise our voices, cracked and worn, a campfire choir once more\nSingin' hymns of resilience, from the scars that we bore\nOutro\nHallelujah, hallelujah, from the hollow we rise\nHallelujah, hallelujah, with strength in our eyes\nThe campfire's memory burns, a beacon in the night\nGuiding us home, bathing our souls in its light.\nHallelujah.",
