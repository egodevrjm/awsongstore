  "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nStepped to the edge where the blue runs free,\nWaves hit my heart like a melody.\nSun’s shinin’ down, got a brand-new view,\nEvery moment’s brighter ‘cause I’m here with you.\nChorus:\nWatchin’ forever and comin’ away happy,\nSoul’s on fire, and my heart’s snappin’ snappy.\nOcean’s singin’, and I’m feelin’ alive,\nWatchin’ forever, gonna thrive, gonna thrive!\nVerse 2:\nKick off my boots, let the sand take hold,\nYour smile’s the spark that’s worth more than gold.\nLaughin’ in the breeze, we’re a carefree song,\nDancin’ with the waves, where we both belong.\nChorus:\nWatchin’ forever and comin’ away happy,\nSoul’s on fire, and my heart’s snappin’ snappy.\nOcean’s singin’, and I’m feelin’ alive,\nWatchin’ forever, gonna thrive, gonna thrive!\nBridge:\nAin’t no worries when the tide rolls in,\nEvery heartbeat’s where our story begins.\nRaise a glass to the sky, let the good times roll,\nThis kinda joy’s what we’re livin’ for.\nChorus:\nWatchin’ forever and comin’ away happy,\nSoul’s on fire, and my heart’s snappin’ snappy.\nOcean’s singin’, and I’m feelin’ alive,\nWatchin’ forever, gonna thrive, gonna thrive!\nOutro:\nYeah, watchin’ forever with a grin ear to ear,\nGot this moment, and I’m holdin’ it near.\nComin’ away happy, gonna shout to the sky,\nWatchin’ forever, we’ll never say goodbye!",

  "sounds_like_acoustic": "Alex’s rusted guitar strums bright, major chords with a lively, wave-like rhythm, its gritty tone blending with his gravelly, joyful vocals. The performance is raw and intimate, with a faint string buzz and ocean waves adding a sunny, beachside charm.",
  "sounds_like_recording": "A crisp acoustic guitar leads a full band with driving drums, twangy electric riffs, and a bouncy fiddle, creating a vibrant, radio-ready anthem. Alex’s raspy vocals soar with reverb and harmonies, backed by banjo and tambourine for a polished, summery feel.",
