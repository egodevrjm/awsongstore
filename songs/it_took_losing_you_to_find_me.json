  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEmpty echoes in this dawn's soft light\nShadows stretch where your promises died at night\nUsed to chase your whispers on the breeze\nNow I'm chasing something only I can seize\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFields once sown with our shared lies\nNow bloom with truths I can’t deny\nYour absence taught me how to fly\n[Chorus]\nI buried your lies in the fields of my youth\nLaid down the blame and picked up the truth\nYou broke me to set me free\nIt took losin’ you to find me\n[Verse 2]\nMiles of highway, miles inside my soul\nUsed to follow you, now I’m taking control\nBroken pieces scattered on the ground\nBuilt myself up stronger, no lookin’ back around\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFields once sown with our shared lies\nNow bloom with truths I can’t deny\nYour absence taught me how to fly\n[Chorus]\nI buried your lies in the fields of my youth\nLaid down the blame and picked up the truth\nYou broke me to set me free\nIt took losin’ you to find me\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I needed to lose it all\nTo rise from the ashes, stand up tall\nEvery tear I shed, a cleansing rain\nWashing away the hurt, erasing the pain\n[Post-Chorus]\nEvery wound became the road I walked\nI sowed redemption in every talk\nRising stronger than the past I fought\n[Chorus]\nI buried your lies in the fields of my youth\nLaid down the blame and picked up the truth\nYou broke me to set me free\nIt took losin’ you to find me\n[Outro]\nMorning fog lifts, a new day starts to gleam\nYeah, it took losin’ you to wake up from the dream\nFind me, find me, find me... now I’m free.",
