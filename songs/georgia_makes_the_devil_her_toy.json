  "lyrics": "The Devil crept back to Georgia,\nHis heart a smoldering wreck.\nTwice she’d won, left him undone,\nBut he craved her spellbound neck.\nHe found her lounging by a moonlit spring,\nHer skin aglow with wicked delight.\n“Georgia, you’ve won, but I ain’t done—\nLet’s tangle one last night.”\nShe arched a brow, her lips a curve,\n“Devil, you’re bold to try.\nYou’ve lost my game, but I’ll stake a claim,\nThis time, you’re *mine* to fry.”\nShe rose like smoke, her voice a hook,\nAnd pinned him with a stare.\n“Step to my tune, under this moon,\nOr crawl back to your lair.”\nChorus:\nEmbers in the night, her will’s the chain,\nGeorgia’s got the Devil on a short rein.\nSilk and steel, she’s calling the play,\nThe Devil’s just a toy in her sway.\nGeorgia moved like a voodoo queen,\nHer touch a brand on his soul.\nEach sultry glance spun a tighter dance,\nAnd she took complete control.\nHis pride dissolved in her honeyed grip,\nHis pleas a whispered song.\nShe wove her charm, disarmed his harm,\nAnd owned him all night long.\nWhen the sun spilled gold through the willow’s veil,\nThe Devil was hers to keep.\nBound by her spell, he couldn’t rebel,\nHis heart in her hands ran deep.\n“Darlin’, you’re mine,” she purred with a grin,\n“My toy ‘til I say when.”\nShe snapped her fingers, and off he slunk,\nTo serve her again and again.\nChorus:\nEmbers in the night, her will’s the chain,\nGeorgia’s got the Devil on a short rein.\nSilk and steel, she’s calling the play,\nThe Devil’s just a toy in her sway.\nOutro:\nThe Devil came down to Georgia,\nBut Georgia claimed the prize.\nShe turned that silver-tongued sinner\nInto a spark in her eyes.",
