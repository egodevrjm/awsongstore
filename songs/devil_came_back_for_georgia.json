  "lyrics": "The Devil Came Back to Georgia\nThe Devil came back to Georgia,\nHe was burnin’ for a second round.\nThat first defeat left his pride in heat,\nAnd he craved that sultry sound.\nHe found her swayin’ by a riverside,\nUnder stars that pulsed with sin,\nHer eyes like coals, she stirred his soul,\nAnd he swore he’d win her grin.\n“Well, darlin’, I’m back,” he purred with a leer,\n“Got a new game to ignite.\nYou scorched me once, but I’m no dunce,\nThis time I’ll own the night.”\nHe flicked his tongue, let the shadows hum,\nAnd the air grew thick with lust.\n“I’ll raise the stakes, make no mistake,\nThis dance’ll turn you to dust.”\nGeorgia laughed, her voice like wine,\n“Devil, you’re barkin’ up my tree.\nYou think you’re sly, but I’ll make you cry,\n‘Cause this fire belongs to me.”\nShe stepped in close, her breath a tease,\nLet her fingers graze his chest.\n“Bring your best, I’ll do the rest,\nAnd put your wicked heart to rest.”\nChorus:\nSparks on the river, flames in the dark,\nGeorgia’s got that untamed spark.\nVelvet and venom, a dangerous game,\nThe Devil’s lost in Georgia’s flame.\nThe Devil moved with a serpent’s grace,\nEvery touch a fevered spell.\nHe wove his charm, thought he’d do no harm,\nBut Georgia knew his hell.\nShe matched his heat, step for step,\nHer hips a taunting dare,\nEach whispered word made his senses blur,\nTill he was drowning in her stare.\nWhen the dawn crept soft through the cypress shade,\nThe Devil knelt, undone.\nGeorgia smirked, her magic worked,\nShe’d played him ‘til she’d won.\n“You thought you’d tame me, sweet Lucifer,\nBut I’m the queen of this domain.”\nShe blew a kiss, left him in bliss,\nAnd sent him back to his pain.\nChorus:\nSparks on the river, flames in the dark,\nGeorgia’s got that untamed spark.\nVelvet and venom, a dangerous game,\nThe Devil’s lost in Georgia’s flame.\nOutro:\nThe Devil came back to Georgia,\nBut Georgia stole the crown.\nShe spun that sly ol’ sinner\nAnd burned his kingdom down.",
