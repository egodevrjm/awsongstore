  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nBorn in the shadow of a coal-black vein,\nWhere the hollers weep and the skies bleed rain.\nDad’s fists were iron, his heart cold stone,\nBut I carved my soul from the roots I’ve known.\nPre-Chorus\nRaised by dust and gospel’s steady call,\nForged in shafts where shadows crawl,\nMy will hammered into iron walls.\nChorus\nForged in the hills where the wild winds howl,\nRaised by the mines and the gospel sound.\nI got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—\nThis heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.\nVerse 2\nSweat and grit built these hands of mine,\nCrawled through darkness for a dollar’s shine.\nEvery scar’s a story, every ache a fight,\nI’m standin’ tall in the fading light.\nPre-Chorus\nRaised by dust and gospel’s steady call,\nForged in shafts where shadows crawl,\nMy will hammered into iron walls.\nChorus\nForged in the hills where the wild winds howl,\nRaised by the mines and the gospel sound.\nI got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—\nThis heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.\nBridge\nFiddle cuts sharp like a miner’s blade,\nEach note’s a fire that the pain remade.\nI’m forged from the hollers, unyielding and true,\nThis spirit’s unbreakable, and it’s carryin’ through.\nChorus\nForged in the hills where the wild winds howl,\nRaised by the mines and the gospel sound.\nI got coal dust blood and a hammer for a will—\nThis heart don’t break—it’s Kentucky steel.\nPost-Chorus\nEvery strike on steel became my song,\nEach scar a verse that made me strong,\nI stand unbroken where I belong.\nOutro \nHollers still echo, but I’m holdin’ the line,\nKentucky steel runs deep in this heart of mine.",
