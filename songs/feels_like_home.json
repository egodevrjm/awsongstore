  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFaded blue threads, patched at the knee\nCarried me through hell, set my soul free\nCoal dust stains from the seams I crawled\nWore ‘em when the world felt too damn small\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThrough the fields at dawn, ‘neath the red dirt’s glow\nEvery tear and fray tells the life I know\nThey held me tight when my heart was torn\nWrapped my bones where my truth was born\n\n\n[Chorus]\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\nCarved my story in thread and stone\nFrom the mines to the roads where I learned to roam\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nSweat-soaked days in the summer’s blaze\nDanced in ‘em drunk under starlit haze\nThey caught my blood when her lies cut deep\nHeld my pride when I couldn’t sleep\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThrough the fields at dawn, ‘neath the red dirt’s glow\nEvery tear and fray tells the life I know\nThey held me tight when my heart was torn\nWrapped my bones where my truth was born\n\n\n[Chorus]\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\nCarved my story in thread and stone\nFrom the mines to the roads where I learned to roam\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\n\n\n[Bridge]\nNo mansion’s walls, no city’s shine\nCould fit my soul like this denim’s mine\nFrom the hollers’ cry to the songs I sing\nThey’re the roots of every damn thing\n\n\n[Chorus]\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\nCarved my story in thread and stone\nFrom the mines to the roads where I learned to roam\nThese old Wranglers feel like home\n\n\n[Outro]\nFiddle hums low, as the night winds moan\nThese old Wranglers feel like home",
