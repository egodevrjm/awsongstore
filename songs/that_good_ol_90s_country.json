  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n1992, dirt roads and FM gold\nGeorge Strait on the radio, stories being told\nLevi's worn thin, boots kicked up high\nChattahoochee memories under Georgia sky\n[Verse 2]\nGarth was king and Faith was rising\nBrooks & Dunn kept dance floors flying\nShania showed us what a woman feels\nWhen country music still had steel\n[Chorus]\nThey don't make 'em like they did back then\nWhen three chords and truth was more than just pretend\nNo Auto-Tune, no drum machines\nJust real songs about real dreams\nThat good ol' 90s country\n[Bridge]\nAlan Jackson taught us how to live\nTravis Tritt showed what love could give\nAnd every small-town Friday night\nWas pure country done just right\n[Chorus]\nThey don't make 'em like they did back then\nWhen three chords and truth was more than just pretend\nNo Auto-Tune, no drum machines\nJust real songs about real dreams\nThat good ol' 90s country\n[Outro]\nYeah, that good ol' 90s country\nWhen the music meant something true\nThat good ol' 90s country\nStill running straight through my blood\nThat good ol' 90s country",
