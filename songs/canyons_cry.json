  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nThere’s a storm in the canyon, tearin’ through my bones,\nThunder’s got my secrets, carved in jagged stones.\nIt howls to break the silence, begs to shake the sky,\nBut the sun’s a ruthless witness, and I’m scared to fly.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe wildfire’s callin’, it won’t let me hide,\nRagin’ for the truth, burnin’ deep inside.\n(Chorus)\nCanyon’s cry, roarin’ through the night,\nScreamin’ all my pain, in a blaze of light.\nIt’s wild, it’s fierce, gonna lift me high,\nCanyon’s cry, born to defy!\n(Verse 2)\nI’ve danced with desert shadows, where the vultures soar,\nClutchin’ truths too heavy, that I can’t ignore.\nThey claw to reach the heavens, like a river’s flood,\nBut the spotlight’s a vulture, circlin’ for my blood.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThe lightning’s pushin’, it won’t let me stay,\nUrgin’ me to holler, chase the dark away.\n(Chorus)\nCanyon’s cry, roarin’ through the night,\nScreamin’ all my pain, in a blaze of light.\nIt’s wild, it’s fierce, gonna lift me high,\nCanyon’s cry, born to defy!\n(Bridge)\nI’ve seen the valley’s altar, where the brave ones fall,\nHeard the siren’s promise, but it steals it all.\nYet this fire in my veins, it’s a rebel’s spark,\nGonna shout my soul, tear the silence apart!\n(Chorus)\nCanyon’s cry, roarin’ through the night,\nScreamin’ all my pain, in a blaze of light.\nIt’s wild, it’s fierce, gonna lift me high,\nCanyon’s cry, born to defy!\n(Outro)\nSo I’ll ride this storm, where the wild winds wail,\nLet the canyon carry my truth’s old tale.\nWith the stars as my witness, I’ll set my pain free,\nCanyon’s cry… it’s livin’ in me.\nYeah, canyon’s cry! (Raise it to the sky!)\nLivin’ in me.\nVibe: The song feels like a thunderstorm in a desert canyon, with the narrator’s pain transforming into a defiant, uplifting cry. It’s intense enough for outlaw fans but anthemic for mainstream crowds, ideal for a festival climax or a movie’s triumphant moment. Performance: Picture the artist in a leather jacket, commanding a stage with a band (electric guitar, banjo, pedal steel, fiddle). The chorus sparks crowd chants, and the bridge could feature a dramatic guitar solo or vocal wail. For TikTok/busking, an acoustic version would rely on fierce strumming and raw vocals. Appeal: The blend of pain and empowerment, plus the driving energy, could make it a chart-climber or social media hit, resonating with listeners seeking catharsis.\nSounds Like\nFull Band/Studio: The polished production amplifies the song’s “raise you up” energy with a full ensemble (electric guitar, pedal steel, banjo, fiddle, drums), making it a radio-ready anthem with outlaw grit, ideal for a festival or soundtrack. Acoustic/Live/Busking: Stripped to a single acoustic guitar, the raw vocals and rhythmic strumming preserve the song’s intensity and pain, perfect for an intimate TikTok live stream or a Nashville street corner, where the allegorical lyrics shine.",
