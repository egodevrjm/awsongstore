  "lyrics": "Red Dirt Road\n(Verse 1)\nSunrise paints the cotton fields a hazy shade of gold\nAnother town I can't recall, another story told\nOf a restless heart and wandering feet, a shadow in the night\nSearching for a place to land, a flicker of guiding light\nThey call me outlaw, rebel soul, a drifter through and through\nBut beneath this hardened shell, a homesick heart beats true\n(Chorus)\nRed dirt road, windin' back to where I belong\nWhere the cypress trees stand tall and the mockingbird's sweet song\nEchoes through the valleys, a memory so clear\nRed dirt road, whisperin' \"you're finally here\"\n(Verse 2)\nRan from the whispers, the judgment in their eyes\nFrom the expectations heavy, beneath these southern skies\nThought I could outrun the past, the ghosts that held me down\nBut freedom's just a hollow word in every nameless town\nTraded family for the highway, love for open space\nNow I see the emptiness etched upon my weary face\n(Bridge)\nThe asphalt ribbon stretched on, a promise never kept\nOf something more, something different, a secret I had slept\nWith for too long, a restless dream that turned into a lie\nNow I'm turnin' 'round, headin' back, beneath the open sky\n(Chorus)\nRed dirt road, windin' back to where I belong\nWhere the cypress trees stand tall and the mockingbird's sweet song\nEchoes through the valleys, a memory so clear\nRed dirt road, whisperin' \"you're finally here\"\n(Outro)\nDust devils dancin' in the afternoon sun's glow\nRed dirt road, takin' me home, slow and low\nYeah, takin' me home, slow and low.\nRed dirt road, I'm finally home, I know.",
