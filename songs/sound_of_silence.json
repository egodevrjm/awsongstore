  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOne AM, bar closed down\nTook a shot of whiskey, it ain't helpin' now\nTo shut my mind off, stop it from racin'\nI turn to what I've been chasin'\n\n[Chorus]\nThe sound of silence\nI find it on the road at night drivin'\nIn my bed when the storm is outside it\nIt's like a choir singin' to my soul\nI've been prayin' that I'll find it\nIn my head, so I can't deny it\nWhen I do, you know I'll invite it\nInto my heart and never let it go\nIt's the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Fore you know it, your life is half gone\nStill tryin' to figure out where you belong\nTo shut my mind off, stop it from racin'\nI turn to what I've been chasin'\n\n[Chorus]\nThe sound of silence\nI find it on the road at night drivin'\nIn my bed when the storm is outside it\nIt's like a choir singin' to my soul\nI've been prayin' that I'll find it\nIn my head, so I can't deny it\nWhen I do, you know I'll invite it\nInto my heart and never let it go\nIt's the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverywhere I go, everywhere I go\nIt never seems to leave me alone\nEverywhere I go, everywhere I go\nI'm drownin' in this world\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I need the sound of silence\nI find it on the road at night drivin'\nIn my bed when the storm is outside it\nIt's like a choir singin' to my soul\nI've been prayin' that I'll find it\nIn my head, so I can't deny it\nWhen I do, you know I'll invite it\nInto my heart and never let it go\nIt's the sound of silence",
