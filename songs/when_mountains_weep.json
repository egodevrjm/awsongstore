  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCoal dust settles where the pines grow thin\nHollers whisper of the hurt within\nGraves unmarked beneath the ridge’s weight\nHold the dreams that time forgot to save\n[Pre-Chorus]\nRivers carve the scars my fathers wore\nSilent hollers crying out once more\nStone and sweat forever at war\n[Chorus]\nThe hollers cry where the coal veins died\nThe rivers mourn where our fathers lied\nWhen blood stains stone and secrets keep\nEven the mountains, even they weep\n[Verse 2]\nMama’s prayers sank in the valley’s shade\nPappa’s hands broke for the debts unpaid\nTheir ghosts still walk where the wildflowers fade\nIn the shadow of the lives they made\n[Pre-Chorus]\nRivers carve the scars my fathers wore\nSilent hollers crying out once more\nStone and sweat forever at war\n[Chorus]\nThe hollers cry where the coal veins died\nThe rivers mourn where our fathers lied\nWhen blood stains stone and secrets keep\nEven the mountains, even they weep\n[Bridge]\nEvery seam I crawled, I learned their pain\nEvery callus holds a family’s chain\nBetrayed by love, by land, by greed\nI sing for souls this world don’t need\n[Post-Chorus]\nWind carries tales of loss and shame\nEach echo bearing an unspoken name\nI sing their sorrow into lasting flame\n[Chorus]\nThe hollers cry where the coal veins died\nThe rivers mourn where our fathers lied\nWhen blood stains stone and secrets keep\nEven the mountains, even they weep\n[Outro]\nBeneath the peaks where the silence sleeps\nEven the mountains, even they weep",
