  "lyrics": "Verse 1\n\nEvery mornin’ she’d slip through that diner door,\n\nSame old booth, coffee black, nothin’ more.\n\nNever spoke, just stared where the shadows creep,\n\nToday her seat’s empty, and the silence cuts deep.\n\nChorus\n\nOh, the empty seat, where’d she go?\n\nCarried her story where nobody knows.\n\nA ghost in the booth, left a chill in the air,\n\nEmpty seat’s whisperin’, she ain’t there.\n\nVerse 2\n\nWorn-out coat, eyes like a lonesome rain,\n\nNo one asked her story, not even her name.\n\nWaitress hums soft, but the counter feels wrong,\n\nHer shadow’s gone quiet, where it used to belong.\n\nChorus\n\nOh, the empty seat, where’d she go?\n\nCarried her story where nobody knows.\n\nA ghost in the booth, left a chill in the air,\n\nEmpty seat’s whisperin’, she ain’t there.\n\nBridge\n\nWas she runnin’ from hurt, or chasin’ a dream?\n\nLost in the cracks of a life’s frayed seam.\n\nThat booth holds her echo, a truth left unsaid,\n\nA stranger’s gone missin’, but she ain’t dead.\n\nChorus\n\nOh, the empty seat, where’d she go?\n\nCarried her story where nobody knows.\n\nA ghost in the booth, left a chill in the air,\n\nEmpty seat’s whisperin’, she ain’t there.\n\nOutro\n\nIn a small-town diner, ‘neath the hum of the light,\n\nHer seat stays empty, through the long, lonesome night.",
