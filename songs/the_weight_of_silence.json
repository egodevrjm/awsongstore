  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nWords we never spoke cut deeper than his belt,\nEvery silent scream was a wound I felt.\nLearned to bite my tongue ‘fore I learned to pray,\nCarried that quiet through each hellbound day.\nPre-Chorus\nTruth was a ghost in that house of pain,\nBut silence was the chain I broke to stay sane.\nChorus\nScreamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,\nBut I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.\nEvery heavy word we never said still shines —\nIn the weight of silence left behind.\nVerse 2\nDad’s liquor breath was louder than his care,\nHis fists wrote stories in the midnight air.\nI built my strength in the spaces he ignored,\nTurned my mute defiance to a warrior’s sword.\nPre-Chorus\nPain was a language we both understood,\nBut I chose the quiet to carve my own good.\nChorus\nScreamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,\nBut I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.\nEvery heavy word we never said still shines —\nIn the weight of silence left behind.\nBridge\nNow I sing the truths I buried as a boy,\nEach note’s a spark, each chord’s a joy.\nThe weight of silence taught me how to stand,\nI’m breakin’ its chains with these calloused hands.\nChorus\nScreamin’ would’ve been easier than bitin’ my tongue,\nBut I learned early silence wins when the hurt’s been sung.\nEvery heavy word we never said still shines —\nIn the weight of silence left behind.\nOutro\n*(Slow picking: E|-3---3---|)*\nThe weight of silence… I’m leavin’ it behind.",
