  "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nCame to this town with a song in my heart,\nVoice full of dreams, but the world’s played hard.\nWaitin’ on tables, sweepin’ floors till dawn,\nHoldin’ to hope when the money’s all gone.\n\nChorus:\nKeep singin’ on, let the truth ring true,\nEvery note’s a fight for the life I pursue.\nThrough the ache and the doubt, I’ll still raise my song,\nHeart’s still burnin’, so I keep singin’ on.\n\nVerse 2:\nMama’s voice echoes, said I’d shine someday,\nBut she’s gone to glory, and I’m still findin’ my way.\nThis old guitar’s my only friend some nights,\nSingin’ to shadows, chasin’ stage lights.\n\nChorus:\nKeep singin’ on, let the truth ring true,\nEvery note’s a fight for the life I pursue.\nThrough the ache and the doubt, I’ll still raise my song,\nHeart’s still burnin’, so I keep singin’ on.\n\nBridge:\nBills stack high, and the dreams wear thin,\nBut my soul’s got a fire that won’t give in.\nEvery scar’s a story, every tear’s a call,\nI’ll sing through the silence till I’ve given it all.\n\nChorus:\nKeep singin’ on, let the truth ring true,\nEvery note’s a fight for the life I pursue.\nThrough the ache and the doubt, I’ll still raise my song,\nHeart’s still burnin’, so I keep singin’ on.\n\nOutro:\nSo here’s my voice, let it carry me home,\nThrough empty rooms where my dreams still roam.\nNo matter how heavy, I’ll carry this dawn,\nWith love in my heart, I keep singin’ on.",
