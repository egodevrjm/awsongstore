Willie Nelson's influence is felt in the relaxed vocal delivery, and the overall feel is reminiscent of a lively Friday night at the Tootsie Orchid Lounge, with a touch of Merle Haggard's storytelling grit. The song concludes with a fading steel guitar and a final, lingering chord, leaving the listener with a sense of both celebration and melancholy.",
